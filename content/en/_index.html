  <div class="hcx-wrapper row align-items-center">
    <div class="col-lg-7 my-2 my-lg-0">
      <p>
        To address these challenges and unlock the full potential of the insurance sector, the Hyper Claims Data Exchange (HCX) Protocol offers a transformative solution. This protocol revolutionizes the way data and information are exchanged, bringing together policyholders, insurers, service providers, and regulators on a unified network. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The HCX Protocol is a set of specifications consisting of APIs, data models, reference architecture, and domain specific standards that enable the creation of decentralised networks. Because of its layered design, insurance use cases can evolve independently and be included in the network. By leveraging digital technologies and an open protocol-based network, the protocol enables seamless data exchange between all ecosystem actors. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The HCX Protocol is an open and collaborative initiative. We encourage diverse stakeholders including insurers, policyholders, service providers, and regulators to join our growing community. Together, we can shape the future of insurance claims processing, foster innovation, and deliver greater value to policyholders.

         Join our vibrant community to stay informed, work together, and help shape the future of the Claims Exchange Protocol.<br>

      <p class="pt-2 pt-lg-0">
        The journey of the HCX (Health Claims Exchange) protocol began with a passionate community of 50+ volunteers comprising stakeholders from across the healthcare ecosystem. This diverse group included insurers, hospitals, third-party administrators (TPAs), insurance technology players, and think tanks. The inspiration behind HCX came from the recommendations of the IRDAI-NHA (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India-National Health Authority) Joint Working Group, which emphasized the creation and adoption of a Health Claims Exchange. With the goal of establishing a transparent, collaborative, and open effort, HCX was initiated as a dedicated platform for health claims use cases, spearheaded by Swasth.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-2 pt-lg-0">
        Since its inception, the HCX community has grown rapidly and now boasts a strength of over 125 dedicated individuals. This dynamic and diverse community is continuously working towards enhancing domain knowledge and refining policy specifications for the health sector. Through active collaboration and knowledge sharing, the community strives to develop best practices, establish robust standards, and promote innovation in health claims processing.

    <h3 class="section-subhead text-center">The journey ahead</h3>
      <p class="pt-2 pt-lg-0">
        Buoyed by the success of the health claims use case, the HCX community is now driven to expand its achievements into other areas of insurance. Drawing on the expertise and experience gained from the health sector, the community aims to extend the benefits of the HCX protocol to various insurance domains. By leveraging the power of collaboration and open participation, the community endeavors to create a standardized and efficient exchange platform that transcends boundaries and enhances the overall insurance ecosystem.
        </p>
      <p class="pt-2 pt-lg-0">
        As the HCX community continues to grow and evolve, it invites insurance industry professionals, regulators, technology enthusiasts, and domain experts to join this transformative initiative. Together, we can shape the future of insurance claims exchange, drive innovation, and foster a more inclusive and efficient insurance landscape.
